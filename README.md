# Bamazon_Project

version 1.0

Hi welcome to my "Bamazon Project"! This code simulates the customer of an Amazon-type application through the command line using SQL and Node.js.

Typical user flow should go like this:

1) Upon loading terminal/git bash, user should enter 'node bamazonCustomer.js'


2)Upon execution, app should display 'table' of products and ask for user input asking which product they'd like to purchase


3)In this example, I'm going to buy some Yeezy's (a highly prized shoe amongst Kanye fans and sneakerheads alike).

4) App will then prompt user to input how many units they would like. I'm going to order 3 pairs of these shoes.

5)Uh oh! Looks like they don't have enough for my order. I'll have to start over. (future versions will not kick you off if you input too large of an amount)

6) Now that I ordered the correct amount, the stock quantity has decreased and my order was 'placed.' App also returns amount spent for order.
